This will become the readme file eventually

Purpose of Project:
    - To learn the basics of git and Python object oriented programming by creating a console based game
    - While the project is a game, the goal is mostly learning and not optimization of gameplay
    - The game itself is rather simple, however basic optimzation of gameplay may be done later
    - The code will need to be refractored with getters and setters eventually
    - The code should also be refractored in general as there was not much prior planning prior
        to beginning programming
